        "description": "A Modified Temporal Graph MLP-Mixer that achieves significant computational speedup over traditional graph-based methods by using a dual-branch architecture with factorized MLP mixing. It efficiently captures both local dynamics and global weather patterns while maintaining performance in probabilistic wind speed postprocessing.",
